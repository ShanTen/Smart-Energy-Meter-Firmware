Need to implement pulling source code from a central repository and executing it

Functionality:
    1. Modularize the code (move libraries to lib folder)
        Change main loop
    2. Move GSM code to a separate file
    3. Add GSM Support to send messages to a number via 2G and also connect to a 4G network
    4. Set up FTP server to pull source code from
     Implement "instructions" schema that tells which version/hash to pull from the server
     Implement version/hash/latest hash saving

    . Set up FTP Client 
    . Create staging area for new source code
    . Each update should be a file/set of files as specified in update instructions

Security: (not required for v0.7)
    1. Public, Private Key Pair
    2. Private key in env variables
    3. Sends 2 packets, 1 is hashed password, 2nd is URL to pull source code from
